# User-Authentication-using-JavaFx-and-SQL

This purpose of this project is to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFx to replicate a User authentication program.

I used IntelliJ IDE to perform the above said task. 
(IntelliJ isn't by default compatible with JavaFx. You will have to manually install the necessary packages. There are many tutorials on YouTube that show you how)

I used xampp control panel to make my system the host to access the database.

Parametrized queries were used to dynamically create an SQL Query everytime the user entered details in the text box.

Necessary comments were added in the code to make it easier to understand.
